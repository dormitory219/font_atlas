# Font Atlas


## Overview

The Font Atlas demonstrates how to render text using OpenGL.

iOS and OpenGLES doesn't provide native support for rendering text in OpenGL screens. This project showcases how to achieve text rendering in OpenGL in iOS. It uses Core Text to calculate the glyph dimensions, load the glyphs onto a texture and render them in realtime.
